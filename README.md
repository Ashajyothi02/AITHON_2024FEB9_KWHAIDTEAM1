This project showcases my expertise in multilingual social media analytics, where I participated in a hackathon organized by KIET Group of Institutions. Using innovative techniques like NLP and data analysis skills, I developed a solution for analyzing social media data across multiple languages. The project involved extracting insights, performing sentiment analysis, and generating actionable recommendations. It involves detecting the derived language of each word in given text and translating the full text into required language.
